## Introduction

Chicago O'Hare has been consistently rated as the worst noise-polluted airport in the United States. In this project, we set out to investigate how the airport impacts its surrounding communities and to find the areas most affected by aircraft noise. By analyzing data on noise events, flight tracks, and housing prices, we aim to reveal the spatial and temporal patterns of noise pollution in the vicinity of O'Hare.

## Motivation

Aircraft noise can significantly disrupt quality of life by causing sleep disturbance, stress, and overall reduced well-being. Given O'Hare's reputation for high noise levels, understanding the frequency and intensity of noise events is essential to guide mitigation strategies and improve community relations. Our work focuses on:

  - Quantifying the number of noise events throughout the day.
  - Mapping noise monitoring stations and correlating them with noise events.
  - Animating noise contours over time to illustrate fluctuations during flight operations.
  - Comparing flight track data with noise events to identify potential hotspots.
  - Exploring associations between housing prices and noise levels to assess the qualitative impact on property values.

## Data Sources

We obtained our data from these reputable sources:

  - [BTS TranStats](https://transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FGK&QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr) – Detailed airport and flight statistics.

  - [Fly Chicago Noise Fact Sheet](https://www.flychicago.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Community/Noise/OHare/ANMS/ORD_Monitors_Introduction_FactSheet.pdf) – Overview of the noise monitoring network at O'Hare.

  - [ORD Single Event Data](https://www.flychicago.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Community/Noise/CDA/ORD_Single_Event_10272024.txt) – Records of individual noise events.

  - [FlightAware AA760 Tracklog](https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL760/history/20241027/1010Z/KORD/KDFW/tracklog) – Historical flight track data for AA760 departing from O'Hare.

  - [Redfin Housing Data](https://www.redfin.com/stingray/api/gis-csv?al=3&cluster_bounds) – Data used to generate a continuous heatmap of housing prices in the surrounding area.

## Project Overview

In our project, we:

  - Load and geocode monitoring site data to pinpoint noise monitors by converting addresses into geographic coordinates.
  - Visualize noise event distributions by creating histograms that display the number of events by hour.
  - Map noise event counts by merging noise event data with monitoring site locations and then displaying an interactive map with markers colored by event counts.
  - Animate noise contours by interpolating SEL values (a measure of noise energy) and animating these contours over the course of a day.
  - Animate flight tracks by overlaying flight track data on a satellite basemap and animating the departure path to visualize the relationship between flight operations and noise events.
  - Analyze housing prices by generating a continuous heatmap from Redfin data and comparing it with our noise contour maps to explore any qualitative associations between housing values and noise levels.

Our analysis provides both visual and quantitative insights into the impact of aircraft noise near O'Hare and offers additional context by comparing these noise levels with local housing prices. Our findings can help inform future noise mitigation strategies and community planning efforts.
